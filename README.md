KillTracker allows players to get rewards for killing mobs and players.  
You can add as many rewards as you want, and different types of rewards, such as  
commands, messages, and items.  
  
Players can get rewards for killing specific entities, such as a cow, from killing a type  
of entity (passive, hostile, neutral), and also from killing other players.  
  
Players can get rewards at certain amounts of kills, such as at 15 kills, and also at kill  
milestones, such as at every 5 kills.  
  
Player kill farming is able to be prevented by disallowing killing of the same  
person within a timeframe.
