KillTracker allows players to get rewards for killing mobs and players.\n
You can add as many rewards as you want, and different types of rewards, such as\n
commands, messages, and items.\n

Players can get rewards for killing specific entities, such as a cow, from killing a type\n
of entity (passive, hostile, neutral), and also from killing other players.\n 

Players can get rewards at certain amounts of kills, such as at 15 kills, and also at kill\n
milestones, such as at every 5 kills.\n

Player kill farming is able to be prevented by disallowing killing of the same\n
person within a timeframe.\n
